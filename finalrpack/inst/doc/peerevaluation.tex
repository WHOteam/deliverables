\chapter{Michael Weinberger}

Michael Weinberger is an extremely effective communicator with a hardworking attitude and a good sense of humor. Working with Michael was a pleasure. He was flexible about scheduling, was receptive to others' ideas but also full of new ones, and made a valuable technical contribution to the project via his skills with Python. Without Michael, this project would not have been possible. If I were to rate Michael's efficacy as a team member $x$, I would rate it:
\\
\begin{math}
x = \frac{10}{10}
\end{math}

\chapter{Zhendan Zhu}

Zhendan Zhu is an incredibly friendly and optimistic person. Working with Zhendan was a pleasure. He always made sure that we were attentive to detail and met all submission requirements. His emphasis on doing our best work possible was a great asset to the group. Without his technical contribution via his expertise with regression modeling in R, the project would not have been possible. If I were to rate Zhendan's efficacy as a team member $x$, I would rate it:
\\
\begin{math}
x = \frac{10}{10}
\end{math}
